## Importance of version/source control

Source control gives users the ability to see what each member of a team working on a project specifically contributed.  If a mistake is made along the way, the version control system can easily identify who and what was being done at the time of the change that caused a problem.  Without it, it would be diffcult to determine who caused the problem if multiple people always have access to the code.  It also allows developers to ensure they are working on the most up to date version of the code. 

Well done!
